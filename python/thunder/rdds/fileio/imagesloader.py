            Dimensions of input image data, ordered with fastest-changing dimension first

        ext: string, optional, default "stack"
            Extension required on data files to be loaded.

        startIdx, stopIdx: nonnegative int. optional.
            Indices of the first and last-plus-one data file to load, relative to the sorted filenames matching
            `datapath` and `ext`. Interpreted according to python slice indexing conventions.
