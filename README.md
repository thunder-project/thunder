> scalable analysis of image and time series analysis in python

Thunder is an ecosystem of tools for the analysis of image and time series data in Python. It provides data structures and algorithms for loading, processing, and analyzing these  data, and can be useful in a variety of domains, including neuroscience, medical imaging, video processing, and geospatial and climate analysis. It can be used locally, but also supports large-scale analysis through the distributed computing engine [`spark`](https://github.com/apache/spark).

Thunder is designed around modularity and composability — the core `thunder` package, in this repository, only defines common data structures and read/write patterns, and most functionality is broken out into several related packages. Each one is independently versioned, with its own GitHub repository for organizing issues and contributions. 

This readme provides an overview of the core `thunder` package, its data types, and methods for loading and saving. Tutorials, detailed API documentation, and info about all associated packages can be found at the [documentation site](http://docs.thunder-project.org).

## install

The core `thunder` package defines data structures and read/write patterns for images and series data. It is built on [`numpy`](https://github.com/numpy/numpy), [`scipy`](https://github.com/scipy/scipy), [`scikit-learn`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn), and [`scikit-image`](https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image), and is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.4. You can install it using:

```
pip install thunder-python
```

If you want to install all related packages at the same time, you can use

```
pip install thunder-python[all]
```

This will additionally install:

- [`thunder-regression`](https://github.com/thunder-project/thunder-regression) mass univariate regression algorithms
- [`thunder-factorization`](https://github.com/thunder-project/thunder-factorization) matrix factorization algorithms 
- [`thunder-registration`](https://github.com/thunder-project/thunder-registration) registration for image sequences
- [`thunder-extraction`](https://github.com/thunder-project/thunder-extraction) feature extraction from image sequences

## example

Here's a short snippet showing how to load an image sequence (in this case random data), median filter it, transform it to a series, detrend and compute a fourier transform on each pixel, then convert it to an array.

```python
import thunder as td

data = td.images.fromrandom()
ts = data.median_filter(3).toseries()
frequencies = ts.detrend().fourier(freq=3).toarray()
```

## usage

Most workflows in Thunder begin by loading data, which can come from a variety of sources and locations, and can be either local or distributed (see below).

The two primary data types are `images` and `series`. `images` are used for collections or sequences of images, and are especially useful when working with movie data. `series` are used for collections of one-dimensional arrays, often representing time series.

Once loaded, each data type can be manipulated through a variety of statistical operators, including simple statistical aggregiations like `mean` `min` and `max` or more complex operations like `gaussian_filter` `detrend` and `subsample`. All operations are parallelized if running against a distributed execution engine like [`spark`](https://github.com/apache/spark). For distributed engines, chained operations will be lazily executed, whereas for local operation they will be executed eagerly.

Both `images` and `series` objects are wrappers for ndarrays: either a local [`numpy`](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) `ndarray` or a distributed ndarray using [`bolt`](https://github.com/bolt-project/bolt) and [`spark`](https://github.com/apache/spark). Calling `toarray()` on an `images` or `series` object at any time returns a local [`numpy`](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) `ndarray`, which is an easy way to move between Thunder and other Python data analysis tools, like [`pandas`](https://github.com/pydata/pandas) and [`scikit-learn`](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn).

For a full list of methods on `image` and `series` data, see the [documentation site](http://docs.thunder-project.org).

## reading

Both `images` and `series` can be loaded from a variety of data types and locations. For all loading methods, the optional argument `engine` allows you to specify whether data should be loaded in `'local'` mode, which is backed by a `numpy` array, or in `'spark'` mode, which is backed by an RDD.

All loading methods are available on the module for the corresponding data type, for example

```python
import thunder as td
data = td.images.fromtif('/path/to/tifs')
data = td.series.fromarray(somearray)
data_distributed = ts.series.fromarray(somearray, engine=sc)
```

The argument `engine` can be either `None` (for local use) or a `SparkContext` (for distributed use with Spark). And all methods that load from files e.g. `fromtif` or `frombinary` can load from either a local filesystem or Amazon S3, with the optional argument `credentials` for S3 credentials. See the [documentation site](http://docs.thunder-project.org) for a full list of data loading methods.
